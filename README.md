## Introduction
This Python script analyzes and plots graphs for a set of mathematical problems. It reads x-values from a file, calculates the corresponding y-values based on predefined functions, and presents the results via plots. Additionally, it saves the results for both x and y values to an output file and after each execution, it prompts the user if they wish to try again.
